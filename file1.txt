Independence Day is marked as the occasion to celebrate the countless sacrifices and struggles our freedom fighters have made to make India independent from British rule. It is observed as a national holiday with a flag hoisting ceremony, parade, and singing the national anthem with patriotic spirit. It was on August 15, 1947 that India was freed from British colonialism by gaining independence.

This year the day will be celebrated in the Red Fort by the address of Prime Minister Narendra Modi with the presence of all Olympians who won medals in The Tokyo Games 2020. Due to the pandemic, the event will be restricted to the public with no cultural performance. Usually, the day is observed with parades and pageants showcasing the scenes of independence struggle to the cultural diversity of India.
